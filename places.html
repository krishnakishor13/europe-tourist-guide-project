      <h1>Lauterbrunnen Valley, Switzerland</h1>
      <p>
        Like something straight out of The Sound of Music, the Lauterbrunnen
        Valley is endlessly picturesque, thanks to its green valleys, snowy
        peaks and charming alpine villages.
        <span class="bold">
          Lauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as in claro fonte. In 1304 it
          was mentioned as Luterbrunnen.[3]
          <br /><br />
          The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single Roman coin
          which was discovered in the Blumental.</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        When the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record,
        during the 13th century, it was owned by the Freiherr of Wädenswil. In
        1240 the Freiherr of Wädenswil sold the Sefinen Valley to Interlaken
        Monastery. Over the following century, the Monastery and other local
        lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring
        valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his
        Walser speaking people in the nearby Lötschen Valley and into the
        highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of
        Lauterbrunnen. <br /><br />
        Gimmelwald, Mürren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village
        governments and a certain amount of independence from the Monastery.
        Three years later, much of the Bernese Oberland unsuccessfully rose up
        against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed the rebellion, the
        Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery’s wrath.[3] <br /><br />
        <span class="bold"
          >By the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the
          large parish of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of Gsteigwiler).
          Between 1487 and 1488, the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a filial
          church of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest
          for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of
          the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese
          Oberland. Lauterbrunnen joined many other village and the Monastery in
          an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed
          its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Monastery and annexed
          all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new
          Reformed parish.[3]</span

        <br /><br />
        Mines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley
        beginning in the late 16th century. An iron smelter was built in
        Zweilütschinen (now part of Gündlischwand) in 1715 to process the iron
        ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the mines went
        to the noble landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th
        and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the
        villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the
        emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in the
        late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen
        as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps.
        Initially the climbers stayed in the village rectory. However, as
        Lauterbrunnen’s fame grew and with the completion of a road from
        Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 Bernese Oberland Railway, more hotels
        were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist
        infrastructure was also built in the village. <br /><br />
        <span class="bold"
          >They built cable cars to Mürren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But
          the most significant piece of infrastructure was the Jungfrau railway
          which was built in 1912.</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        The Jungfrau rack railway runs 9 km (5.6 mi) from Kleine Scheidegg to
        the highest railway station in Europe at Jungfraujoch. The railway runs
        almost entirely within a tunnel built into the Eiger and Mönch mountains
        and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel, where passengers
        can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built
        into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers Walter and Arnold
        Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen.
        <span class="bold"
          >These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and
          converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The
          tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World War I and
          II and the Great Depression. However, following the end of World War
          II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built
          along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport.[3]
